    <h1>Color Scheme</h1>
    <p>The background color of the website will be #c4f0ff which is a very light shade of blue. <br>
        From there we will have a header and footer color of #d51920 which is a deep red. <br>
        If you hover over a link the "box" surrounding it will be lightened to a #e88185 which is light pink. <br>
        Then general text will be black including but not limited to p tags, h tags, and a tags. </p>
